# Hall Management 

Our depatrment has three projector halls . So the faculty can use them for lecture presentations.

There arose a problem while utilising them.So they decided to allocate the halls on first come first serve basis.

A centralised system was needed to book the halls.

I was given this project . It is my first full stack project for my department.
